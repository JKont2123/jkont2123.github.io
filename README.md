Assignmnent 2: Personal Website

  This website is was created as an assignment for IAT 355.

  Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this website acts as a portfolio for my (Jeremy Kontulahti) work that I have done in this class, and during my IAT career. It contains information on my skill set, experience and contact information.

  Clicking "Visualization" on the top navigation bar takes you to a page containing the two svg visualizations required for this assignment. The first one is a simple bar graph recording how many times I have been to Los Angeles, New York and Vancouver. The second shows 1000 randomly generated circles with differing size and position. Refreshing     the page generates 1000 new circles.
