Assignment 3: Introduction to Data Visualization with Vega-Lite

  This website was created as an assignment for IAT 355.

  Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this website acts as a portfolio for my (Jeremy Kontulahti) work that I have done in this class, and during my IAT career. It contains information on my skill set, experience and contact information.

  Clicking "Visualization" on the top navigation bar takes you to a page containing visualizations required for this assignment.
